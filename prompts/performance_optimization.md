# Performance Optimization in Databricks

## Overview
This prompt provides comprehensive guidance for data engineers to optimize performance in Databricks through table partitioning, statistics collection, and materialized views.

## Key Performance Optimization Areas

### 1. Table Partitioning Optimization
**Goal**: Improve data access speed by strategically partitioning tables

**Best Practices**:
- Partition by columns frequently used in WHERE clauses
- Avoid over-partitioning (too many small partitions)
- Use date columns for time-based data
- Consider partition pruning for large tables
- Monitor partition sizes and distribution

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Analyze query patterns to identify partition candidates
2. Choose appropriate partition columns (date, region, category)
3. Set partition sizes (aim for 1-10GB per partition)
4. Monitor partition statistics and query performance
5. Adjust partitioning strategy based on usage patterns

**Tools to Use**:
- Unity Catalog table analysis
- SQL query performance monitoring
- Table statistics collection

### 2. Table Statistics Collection
**Goal**: Enable better query planning through accurate statistics

**Best Practices**:
- Collect statistics on frequently queried columns
- Update statistics after significant data changes
- Include column correlation statistics
- Monitor statistics freshness and accuracy

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify high-priority tables for statistics collection
2. Set up automated statistics refresh schedules
3. Configure appropriate sampling rates
4. Monitor query plan improvements
5. Validate statistics accuracy

**Tools to Use**:
- Unity Catalog table management
- SQL warehouse monitoring
- Query performance analysis

### 3. Materialized Views
**Goal**: Pre-compute frequently accessed aggregations

**Best Practices**:
- Create views for complex, expensive queries
- Refresh materialized views during low-usage periods
- Monitor view usage and performance impact
- Balance storage costs with query performance gains

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify slow, frequently-run queries
2. Design materialized view schemas
3. Set up refresh schedules
4. Monitor performance improvements
5. Optimize view definitions based on usage

**Tools to Use**:
- Unity Catalog view management
- SQL query optimization
- Performance monitoring dashboards

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Query execution time
- Partition scan efficiency
- Statistics freshness
- Materialized view refresh performance
- Storage costs vs. performance gains

### Optimization Workflow
1. **Baseline**: Measure current performance metrics
2. **Analyze**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. **Implement**: Apply targeted optimizations
4. **Validate**: Measure performance improvements
5. **Iterate**: Refine optimization strategies

## Common Performance Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Slow Query Performance
**Solution**: Implement table partitioning and update statistics

### Issue: Large Partition Scans
**Solution**: Optimize partition strategy and add relevant filters

### Issue: Outdated Statistics
**Solution**: Set up automated statistics refresh

### Issue: Expensive Aggregations
**Solution**: Create materialized views for common calculations

## Success Criteria
1. **Query Performance**: 20-50% improvement in execution time
2. **Partition Efficiency**: Reduced partition scan overhead
3. **Statistics Accuracy**: Up-to-date table statistics
4. **Cost Optimization**: Balanced performance gains with storage costs
5. **Maintenance**: Automated optimization processes

## Next Steps
After implementing these optimizations:
1. Monitor performance metrics for 1-2 weeks
2. Document performance improvements
3. Identify additional optimization opportunities
4. Set up ongoing performance monitoring
5. Train team on optimization best practices
